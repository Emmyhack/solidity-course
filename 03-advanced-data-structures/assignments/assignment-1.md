# Assignment 1: Efficient Data Structures

Build optimized data structures for different use cases and compare their gas efficiency.

## 🎯 Objective

Create and optimize data structures for real-world scenarios, focusing on gas efficiency and access patterns.

## 📝 Tasks

### Task 1: User Management System (30 points)

Create a `UserManager` contract with:

- User registration with unique usernames
- Profile updates with custom attributes
- Friend relationships (bidirectional)
- Efficient user search by different criteria
- Pagination for large user lists

**Requirements:**

- Gas-optimized storage layout
- Multiple indexing strategies
- Batch operations where possible
- Event logging for off-chain indexing

### Task 2: Inventory Management (25 points)

Build an `InventoryManager` for game items:

- Items with categories, rarity, and metadata
- User ownership tracking
- Transfer and trading functionality
- Search by category, rarity, or owner
- Statistics and analytics

**Focus on:**

- Packed structs for gas efficiency
- Efficient enumeration patterns
- Complex filtering capabilities
- Ownership transfer optimizations

### Task 3: Voting System (25 points)

Implement a `VotingSystem` with:

- Multiple concurrent polls
- Different voting mechanisms (single choice, multiple choice, ranked)
- Voter eligibility and weight systems
- Real-time result calculation
- Vote delegation capabilities

**Advanced features:**

- Privacy-preserving votes (commitment-reveal)
- Quadratic voting
- Time-locked voting periods
- Result aggregation algorithms

### Task 4: Analytics Dashboard (20 points)

Create an `AnalyticsDashboard` that aggregates data from previous contracts:

- User activity metrics
- Content engagement statistics
- System-wide trends
- Performance monitoring
- Custom report generation

**Data structures to implement:**

- Time-series data storage
- Aggregation algorithms
- Efficient data retrieval
- Historical data management

## 🔧 Implementation Guidelines
