# Security Fundamentals

Understanding the core principles of smart contract security is essential for building robust, attack-resistant applications.

## 🎯 Security Mindset

### The Security-First Approach

When developing smart contracts, security must be considered from the very first line of code. Unlike traditional software, smart contracts operate in a hostile environment where:

- **Code is immutable** once deployed
- **Bugs can be catastrophically expensive**
- **Attackers are financially motivated**
- **Recovery is often impossible**

### Core Security Principles

#### 1. **Defense in Depth**

Implement multiple layers of security controls:

- Input validation
- Access controls
- Rate limiting
- Circuit breakers
- Monitoring and alerting

#### 2. **Fail Securely**

When something goes wrong, the system should fail in a secure state:

- Pause operations rather than continue unsafely
- Preserve user funds above all else
- Implement emergency recovery mechanisms

#### 3. **Principle of Least Privilege**

Grant the minimum permissions necessary:

- Restrict function access appropriately
- Use role-based access control
- Limit administrative powers

#### 4. **Assume Hostility**

Design as if every user is an attacker:

- Validate all inputs
- Never trust external contracts
- Expect unexpected behavior

## 🛡️ Security Categories

### 1. Code-Level Security

**Input Validation**

```solidity
function transfer(address to, uint256 amount) external {
    require(to != address(0), "Invalid recipient");
    require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    // ... rest of function
}
```

**Access Control**

```solidity
modifier onlyOwner() {
    require(msg.sender == owner, "Unauthorized");
    _;
}

function criticalFunction() external onlyOwner {
    // Sensitive operations
}
```

**Safe Arithmetic**

```solidity
// Solidity 0.8.0+ has built-in overflow protection
function safeAdd(uint256 a, uint256 b) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    return a + b; // Will revert on overflow
}
```

### 2. Economic Security

**Incentive Alignment**

- Ensure honest behavior is more profitable than malicious behavior
- Consider game theory implications
- Design economic penalties for bad actors

**Flash Loan Protection**

```solidity
modifier noFlashLoan() {
    require(tx.origin == msg.sender, "No contract calls");
    _;
}
```

**Price Oracle Security**

```solidity
function getSecurePrice() internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint256 price1 = oracle1.getPrice();
    uint256 price2 = oracle2.getPrice();

    // Use median of multiple oracles
    require(
        abs(price1 - price2) <= price1 / 10, // Within 10%
        "Price deviation too high"
    );

    return (price1 + price2) / 2;
}
```

### 3. Operational Security

**Emergency Controls**

```solidity
bool public paused = false;

modifier whenNotPaused() {
    require(!paused, "Contract is paused");
    _;
}

function emergencyPause() external onlyEmergencyRole {
    paused = true;
    emit EmergencyPause(msg.sender);
}
```

**Upgrade Safety**

```solidity
// Use proxy patterns for upgradeable contracts
// Implement timelocks for upgrades
// Require multi-signature for critical changes
```

## 🔍 Security Analysis Framework

### 1. Threat Modeling

**Identify Assets**

- What value does the contract protect?
- User funds, protocol tokens, governance rights
- Reputation and data integrity

**Map Attack Vectors**

- External attackers
- Malicious users
- Compromised operators
- Economic attacks

**Assess Impact**

- Financial loss
- Service disruption
- Reputation damage
- Legal implications

### 2. Risk Assessment Matrix

| Likelihood | Impact | Risk Level | Actions Required                      |
| ---------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------------------------------- |
| High       | High   | Critical   | Immediate fixes, emergency procedures |
| High       | Medium | High       | Priority fixes, enhanced monitoring   |
| Medium     | High   | High       | Priority fixes, contingency plans     |
| Medium     | Medium | Medium     | Scheduled fixes, regular review       |
| Low        | Any    | Low        | Monitor, document                     |

### 3. Security Requirements

**Functional Security**

- Authentication and authorization
- Data integrity and confidentiality
- Audit trails and logging

**Non-Functional Security**

- Performance under attack
- Availability during incidents
- Recovery capabilities

## 🔒 Security Patterns

### 1. Checks-Effects-Interactions

**Always follow this pattern:**

```solidity
function withdraw(uint256 amount) external {
    // 1. CHECKS
    require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
    require(amount > 0, "Invalid amount");

    // 2. EFFECTS
    balances[msg.sender] -= amount;

    // 3. INTERACTIONS
    (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
    require(success, "Transfer failed");
}
```

### 2. Circuit Breaker Pattern

```solidity
contract CircuitBreaker {
    bool public stopped = false;
    uint256 public lastActionTime;
    uint256 public constant PAUSE_DURATION = 1 hours;

    modifier stopInEmergency() {
        require(!stopped, "Contract is stopped");
        _;
    }

    modifier onlyInEmergency() {
        require(stopped, "Not in emergency");
        _;
    }

    function emergencyStop() external onlyOwner {
        stopped = true;
        lastActionTime = block.timestamp;
    }

    function resume() external onlyOwner onlyInEmergency {
        require(
            block.timestamp >= lastActionTime + PAUSE_DURATION,
            "Pause duration not met"
        );
        stopped = false;
    }
}
```

### 3. Rate Limiting Pattern

```solidity
contract RateLimited {
    mapping(address => uint256) private lastAction;
    uint256 public constant RATE_LIMIT = 1 hours;

    modifier rateLimited() {
        require(
            block.timestamp >= lastAction[msg.sender] + RATE_LIMIT,
            "Rate limit exceeded"
        );
        lastAction[msg.sender] = block.timestamp;
        _;
    }
}
```

### 4. Withdrawal Pattern

```solidity
contract WithdrawalPattern {
    mapping(address => uint256) private pendingWithdrawals;

    function allowWithdrawal(address user, uint256 amount) internal {
        pendingWithdrawals[user] += amount;
    }

    function withdraw() external {
        uint256 amount = pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender];
        require(amount > 0, "No pending withdrawal");

        pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] = 0;

        (bool success, ) = msg.sender.call{value: amount}("");
        if (!success) {
            pendingWithdrawals[msg.sender] = amount;
            revert("Withdrawal failed");
        }
    }
}
```
