# Secure Vault Project

A comprehensive implementation of a ultra-secure vault system demonstrating advanced security patterns and defensive programming techniques.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The Secure Vault is a production-ready smart contract that implements multiple layers of security to protect user funds. It serves as a practical example of how to build resilient, attack-resistant smart contracts.

## 🛡️ Security Features

### 1. Multi-Layer Access Control

- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Different permission levels for different operations
- **Vault-Level Authorization**: Individual vault access management
- **Owner Controls**: Exclusive owner functions for sensitive operations

### 2. Reentrancy Protection

- **ReentrancyGuard**: Prevents recursive calling attacks
- **Checks-Effects-Interactions**: Proper ordering of operations
- **State Consistency**: Ensures atomicity of critical operations

### 3. Input Validation & Sanitization

- **Custom Errors**: Gas-efficient error handling
- **Parameter Validation**: Comprehensive input checking
- **Range Validation**: Bounds checking for all numeric inputs
- **Address Validation**: Zero address and contract checks

### 4. Rate Limiting & Time Controls

- **Action Rate Limiting**: Prevents spam and rapid-fire attacks
- **Configurable Timelocks**: Delays for sensitive operations
- **Daily Withdrawal Limits**: Automatic spending controls
- **Emergency Delays**: Time requirements for emergency actions

### 5. Multi-Signature Security

- **Approval Requirements**: Multiple signatures for large withdrawals
- **Distributed Control**: No single point of failure
- **Configurable Thresholds**: Adjustable security levels

### 6. Emergency Controls

- **Emergency Mode**: Complete contract pause capability
- **Emergency Withdrawals**: Last-resort fund recovery
- **Circuit Breakers**: Automatic protection triggers

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js and npm
- Hardhat or Foundry
- MetaMask or similar wallet

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the project
git clone <repository-url>
cd secure-vault

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run tests
npx hardhat test

# Deploy locally
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

### Basic Usage

```solidity
// 1. Create a vault
uint256 vaultId = secureVault.createVault(
    "My Secure Vault",
    SecurityLevel.HIGH,
    1 ether,  // Daily withdrawal limit
    24 hours  // Timelock duration
);

// 2. Deposit funds
secureVault.deposit{value: 10 ether}(vaultId);

// 3. Request withdrawal
uint256 requestId = secureVault.requestWithdrawal(vaultId, 1 ether);

// 4. Wait for timelock and execute
// (after timelock period expires)
secureVault.executeWithdrawal(requestId);
```

## 🔍 Security Testing

### Test Categories

1. **Reentrancy Tests**

   - Test against recursive calling
   - Verify state consistency
   - Check fund safety

2. **Access Control Tests**

   - Unauthorized access attempts
   - Role-based permission validation
   - Ownership transfer security

3. **Input Validation Tests**

   - Invalid parameter handling
   - Edge case testing
   - Overflow/underflow attempts

4. **Rate Limiting Tests**

   - Rapid action attempts
   - Time window validation
   - Bypass attempt prevention

5. **Emergency Tests**
   - Emergency activation/deactivation
   - Emergency withdrawal procedures
   - Recovery mechanisms

### Running Security Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
npm run test

# Run specific test suites
npm run test:security
npm run test:reentrancy
npm run test:access-control
npm run test:rate-limiting
npm run test:emergency

# Run gas optimization tests
npm run test:gas

# Generate coverage report
npm run coverage
```

## 🛠 Development Guide

### Adding New Security Features

1. **Identify Security Requirement**

   - Analyze potential attack vectors
   - Define security properties
   - Choose appropriate patterns

2. **Implement Security Layer**

   - Add validation logic
   - Implement protection mechanisms
   - Add monitoring events

3. **Test Thoroughly**

   - Unit test new features
   - Integration test interactions
   - Security test edge cases

4. **Document Security Model**
   - Update security documentation
   - Add usage examples
   - Document assumptions

### Security Review Checklist

- [ ] All inputs validated
- [ ] Access controls implemented
- [ ] Reentrancy protection added
- [ ] Safe arithmetic used
- [ ] Events emitted for monitoring
- [ ] Emergency controls functional
- [ ] Tests cover edge cases
- [ ] Documentation updated

## 📊 Gas Optimization

The contract uses several gas optimization techniques:

1. **Custom Errors**: More efficient than string revert messages
2. **Packed Structs**: Optimized storage layout
3. **Efficient Loops**: Minimized gas consumption
4. **Storage Access**: Cached expensive reads
5. **Event Optimization**: Indexed parameters for filtering

## 🔧 Configuration

### Security Levels

```solidity
enum SecurityLevel {
    LOW,     // Basic security (single signature)
    MEDIUM,  // Enhanced security (timelock required)
    HIGH,    // Maximum security (multi-sig + timelock)
    CRITICAL // Ultra-secure (all features enabled)
}
```

### Timelock Settings

```solidity
uint256 public constant MIN_TIMELOCK = 24 hours;
uint256 public constant MAX_TIMELOCK = 365 days;
uint256 public constant EMERGENCY_DELAY = 48 hours;
```

### Rate Limiting

```solidity
uint256 public constant RATE_LIMIT_DURATION = 1 hours;
uint256 public constant MAX_VAULTS_PER_USER = 10;
```

## 🚨 Security Warnings

1. **Private Key Security**: Keep private keys secure and never share them
2. **Contract Upgrades**: This contract is not upgradeable by design for security
3. **Emergency Procedures**: Understand emergency procedures before deployment
4. **Gas Limits**: Be aware of gas limits for large operations
5. **Front-running**: Consider MEV protection for sensitive operations
