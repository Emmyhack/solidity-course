## 🐛 Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: "Gas estimation failed"

**Solution**: Check function requirements - are you registered? Do you have enough balance?

### Issue: "Invalid address"

**Solution**: Make sure all address parameters are valid Ethereum addresses (start with 0x)

### Issue: "Execution reverted"

**Solution**: Read the error message - likely a require() statement failed

### Issue: "Out of gas"

**Solution**: Increase gas limit in MetaMask or use more ETH

### Issue: "Nonce too low"

**Solution**: Reset MetaMask account in Settings > Advanced > Reset Account
