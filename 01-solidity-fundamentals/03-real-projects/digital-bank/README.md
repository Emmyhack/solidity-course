##  Getting Started

### **Option 1: Remix IDE (Recommended for Beginners)**

1. Open [remix.ethereum.org](https://remix.ethereum.org)
2. Create a new workspace called "DigitalBank"
3. Follow the step-by-step tutorials below

### **Option 2: Local Development (Advanced)**

1. Install Node.js and npm
2. Set up Hardhat development environment
3. Clone the project structure
4. Run local blockchain for testing
