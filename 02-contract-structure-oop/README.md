# Module 2: Contract Structure & Object-Oriented Programming

Learn advanced contract architecture, inheritance, and object-oriented programming patterns in Solidity.

##  Learning Objectives

By the end of this module, you will:

- Master contract inheritance and polymorphism
- Create and use custom modifiers
- Implement abstract contracts and interfaces
- Use libraries for code reuse
- Design event-driven architectures
- Apply object-oriented design patterns
- Build modular and maintainable contracts

##  Topics Covered

### 1. Contract Inheritance

- Single and multiple inheritance
- Function overriding and `virtual`/`override`
- Constructor inheritance
- Abstract contracts
- Interface implementation

### 2. Modifiers & Access Control

- Custom modifier creation
- Modifier inheritance and overriding
- Access control patterns
- Role-based permissions
- Multi-signature patterns

### 3. Events & Communication

- Event design patterns
- Indexed vs non-indexed parameters
- Event inheritance
- Cross-contract communication
- Event filtering and listening

### 4. Libraries & Code Reuse

- Library creation and usage
- `using` directives
- Internal vs external libraries
- Safe math and utility libraries

### 5. Advanced Contract Patterns

- Factory patterns
- Registry patterns
- Proxy patterns (introduction)
- Pausable contracts
- Ownable patterns

##  Development Tools

Continue using Remix IDE, but also start exploring:

- VS Code with Solidity extensions
- Hardhat (preview for Module 5)
- Gas optimization techniques
